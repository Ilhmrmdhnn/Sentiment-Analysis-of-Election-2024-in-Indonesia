# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Election-2024-in-Indonesia

## Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis on public opinions regarding Indonesian politics in the lead-up to the 2024 elections. The analysis uses advanced natural language processing models including BERT, Vader, and TextBlob to assess sentiment based on social media data.

## Key Features
1. Data Collection:
* Gathering social media data related to Indonesian politics from various platforms such as Twitter, and Youtube.
* Preprocessing data to remove noise, handle missing values, and tokenize text.

2. Sentiment Analysis Models:
* BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):
  * Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification.
   Using BERT to capture nuanced and context-rich sentiment from text data.
* Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):
  * Applying Vader for rule-based sentiment analysis, particularly effective on social media text.
* TextBlob:
  * Utilizing TextBlob for simple and fast sentiment analysis through its built-in sentiment classification capabilities.

3. Model Comparison:
* Comparing the performance of BERT, Vader, and TextBlob in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Evaluating model effectiveness on different types of social media data.

4. Sentiment Trend Analysis:
* Analyzing sentiment trends over time to identify shifts in public opinion leading up to the election.
* Visualizing sentiment distribution and key topics of discussion.

5. Visualization:
* Creating interactive visualizations to present sentiment analysis results.
* Using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for effective data visualization.
